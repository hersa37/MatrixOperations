# MatrixOperations
Currently a work in progress. My own small project to make codes for various matrix operations. Other than that, it's just a nice exercise to test out various coding concepts I'm  learning

Current features:
- Calculate inverse of 3x3 matrix with row expansion
- Elementary row operations
- Gauss/Gauss-Jordan operations with steps

What I plan on expanding:

- Calculate inverse of any matrix size with 
- ~~Do elementary row operations and gauss-jordan operations~~ 
- Vector space operations

I try to not copy other people's code, though help would be great
