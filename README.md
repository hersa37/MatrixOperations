# MatrixInverse
Currently a work in progress. My own small project to make codes for matrices.

As of now, it can calculate the inverse of a 3x3 matrix with row expansion.

What I plan on expanding:
-Calculate inverse of any size
-Do elementary row operations

I try to not copy other people's code, though help would be great
